I'm Rumbleminze, I've enjoyed doing various romhacking and retro projects for some time.  Most notably I've ported several NES games to run natively on the SNES.  In addition to NES ports, I'm the co-author of the Kid Icarus Randomizer (which I've also ported to the SNES).

Beyond that I'm a fan of all things retro tech.

### More Information

You can find all my ports here on the Internet Archive:
